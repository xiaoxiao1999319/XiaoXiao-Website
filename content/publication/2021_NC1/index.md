abstract: In rigid metal or metal alloys, magnetoelastic effect characterizes the change of their magnetic properties under mechanical deformation. This effect has been ignored in textile electronics because of material rigidity. Here we show magnetoelastic effect can also exist in 1D soft fibers with stronger magnetomechanical coupling than that in traditional metal alloys. This effect is explained by a wavy chain model based on the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and demagnetizing factor. To facilitate practical applications, we further invented a textile magnetoelastic generator (MEG), weaving 1D soft fibers with conductive yarns to couple the observed magnetoelastic effect with magnetic induction, which paves a new way for biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion with short-circuit current density of 0.63 mA cm-2, internal impedance of 180 â„¦, low detection limit of 0.05 kPa and intrinsic waterproofness. Textile MEG was demonstrated to convert the arterial pulse into electrical signals with heavy perspiration, even in underwater situation without encapsulations.
