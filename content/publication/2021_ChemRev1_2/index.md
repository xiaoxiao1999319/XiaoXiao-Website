abstract: Traditional public health systems are suffering from limited, delayed, and inefficient medical services, especially when confronted with the pandemic and the aging population. Fusing traditional textiles with diagnostic, therapeutic, and protective medical devices can unlock electronic textiles (e-textiles) as point-of-care platform technologies on the human body, continuously monitoring vital signs and implementing round-the-clock treatment protocols in close proximity to the patient. This review comprehensively summarizes the research advances on e-textiles for wearable point-of-care systems. We start with a brief introduction to emphasize the significance of e-textiles in the current healthcare system. Then, we describe textile sensors for diagnosis, textile therapeutic devices for medical treatment, and textile protective devices for prevention, by highlighting their working mechanisms, representative materials, and clinical application scenarios. Afterward, we detail e-textilesâ€™ connection technologies as the gateway for real-time data transmission and processing in the context of 5G technologies and Internet of Things. Finally, we provide new insights into the remaining challenges and future directions in the field of e-textiles. Fueled by advances in chemistry and materials science, textile-based diagnostic devices, therapeutic devices, protective medical devices, and communication units are expected to interact synergistically to construct intelligent, wearable point-of-care textile platforms, ultimately illuminating the future of healthcare system in the Internet of Things era
