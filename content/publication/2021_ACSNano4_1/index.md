abstract: An expanding elderly population and people with disabilities pose considerable challenges to the current healthcare system. As a practical technology that integrates systems and services, assistive physical therapy devices are essential to maintain or to improve an individualâ€™s functioning and independence, thus promoting their well-being. Given technological advancements, core components of self-powered sensors and optimized machine-learning algorithms will play innovative roles in providing assistive services for unmet global needs. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the latest developments in machine-learning-aided assistive physical therapy devices based on emerging self-powered sensing systems and a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in this field.
