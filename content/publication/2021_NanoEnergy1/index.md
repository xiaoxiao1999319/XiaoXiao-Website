abstract: The efficient conversion of ultrasound into electrical energy remains a highly desirable wireless powering solution, with potentially profound ramifications in energy transfer across virtually all industrial fields, especially for implantable medical devices. Triboelectric nanogenerators have been shown to effectively carry out ultrasound energy transduction, though efficiency remains poor. Here, we devised a computational model to investigate the optimal triboelectric nanogenerator irradiation conditions, including frequencies, distances, sizes, and design, as represented by irradiated triboelectric surface area displacement. Our investigation may set the foundations for the establishment of a standardized protocol for efficient ultrasound mechanical energy harvesting. This holds considerable significance and could be paramount in designing an ever-growing number of applicative solutions in wireless energy transfer, providing a scalable, cost effective and time saving solution in the development of implantable medical devices.
