abstract: Wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (W-TENGs) have triggered considerable attention in light of their broad and diverse biomedical applications, from biomonitoring to therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the use of W-TENGs for self-powered/self-administered therapeutic interventions, classifying them on the basis of materials chemistry, working mechanism, and advanced device design. Specifically, we discuss the use of various W-TENG-based devices in drug delivery, muscle stimulation, tissue regeneration, and assistive therapy. We end the review by discussing academic and industrial trends for W-TENGs in the future of therapeutic devices. This review showcases the significant potential of W-TENGs as an emerging technological platform that will permeate many medical fields.
