abstract: Camouflage techniques are an integral part of the natural world. Despite having developed many technological approaches, creating a solution which can simultaneously modulate its visible and infrared appearance remains a great challenge and highly desired. We present a moisture assisted photo-engineered textile that visually blends objects into the surroundings both in the visible and infrared spectrum. In our solution, moisture content inside has been rendered sensitive to ambient temperature variations, allowing the textile to self-adaptively adjust its thermal emissivity in a wide range of 0.8 to 0.27 with the temperature varying from 25.8 °C to 67.4 °C. Its visible appearance can also be tuned using an interferometric structural color filter to deliver a broad range of colors. The moisture assisted photo-engineered textile features a low-cost, biocompatible, flexible, lightweight and convenient approach for visible and self-adaptive infrared dual camouflage.
