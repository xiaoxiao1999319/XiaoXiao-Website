abstract: Wound healing, one of the most complex processes in the human body, involves the spatial and temporal synchronization of a variety of cell types with distinct roles. Slow- or nonhealing skin wounds have potentially life-threatening consequences, ranging from infection, to scar, clot and hemorrhage formation. Recently, the advent of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has brought about a plethora of opportunities for self-powered wound healing in view of TENGsâ€™ pertinent features which span from a wide range of constitutive biocompatible materials available, to simple fabrication, reduced portable size, high output power, and low cost. State-of-the-art designs are discussed in each section to provide a broader understanding of TENG applications in wound healing. Although some challenges remain, TENGs are proving to be promising platforms for human-centric therapeutics in the era of Internet of Things.
