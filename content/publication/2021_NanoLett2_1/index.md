abstract: Gas bubble manipulations in liquid have long been concerned due to its vital role in various gas-related fields. To deal with the weakness in long-distance gas transportation of previous works, we take inspiration from the Nepenthes pitcher plant's leaves, and successfully prepared a two-dimensional superaerophilic surface decorated with asymmetric aerophobic barriers capable of unidirectional and long-distance gas bubble delivery. For the first time, this process is investigated by in-situ bubble releasing experiments under the record of a high-speed camera and finite element modeling, which demonstrates a kinetic process regulated by the anisotropic motion resistance arising from the patterns. Furthermore, the Nepenthes alata-inspired two-dimensional surface (NATS) is integrated into water electrolysis system for H2 directional transportation and efficient collection. As a result, the NATS design is proved to be a potential solution for facile manipulation of gas bubbles and provides a simple, adaptive, and reliable strategy for long-range gas transport underwater.
